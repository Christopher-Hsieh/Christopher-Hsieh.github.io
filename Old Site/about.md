I am a recent graduate from Purdue University, with a degree in Computer Science. I enjoy messing around with random projects and have recently entered into the open source realm. 

Feel free to contact me (Chrishsieh@live.com) if you think I would enjoy a project you are working on! I love jumping into new technologies and learning about how things are made. I might not have time to consistently contribute, but if the project looks cool I will be sure to check it out!

Be sure to follow me on GitHub!
